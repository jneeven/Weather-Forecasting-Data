# WeatherForecasting
WIP. Data files used in the research described by "Conformal Stacked Weather Forecasting" by Jelmer Neeven and Evgueni Smirnov.

The Ground Truth Data folder contains the values provided by the NOAA, as well as an R script that requests this data through their API.
The Scraped Data folder contains the values as scraped from the eight weather forecasting websites over several months.

Usage instructions will be supplied later, but if you have any questions feel free to contact me at j.neeven@student.maastrichtuniversity.nl
